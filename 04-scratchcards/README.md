# Scratchcards

This one was quite straightforward. Find the numbers common to two sets.

## Features
- Regular expressions
- Set intersections


## Part 1
Load the scratch card and the guesses into sets then look for the intersection.


## Part 2
Keep track of how many of each card we have. Is this what a defaultdict is for? I initialised all the values of the dict first
so that made things easier.
